Lichess Bot Setup:
    - Account: tombot1234
    - Engine: v18_engine (UCI protocol)
    - Config: lichess-bot-master/config.yml
    - Time controls: blitz, rapid, classical
    - Matchmaking: auto-challenges other bots every 1 min; offers rematch after a win
    - Uses Lichess opening explorer (masters) and online endgame tablebases (7-piece)
    - Run with: cd lichess-bot-master && python lichess-bot.py


Running the Bot:
    # Compile all C engines (only needed once, or after code changes):
    cd c_rewrite && make

    # Run the Lichess bot (config points to v18):
    cd lichess-bot-master && python lichess-bot.py

    # Test the engine directly via UCI:
    echo -e "uci\nisready\nposition startpos moves e2e4 e7e5\ngo depth 10\nquit" | ./c_rewrite/v18_engine

    # Run tournament at fixed depth:
    python tests/uci_tournament.py --engine1 c_rewrite/v14_engine --engine2 c_rewrite/v15_engine --positions 15 --depth 10

    # Old v12 Python engine (still available):
    python -c "import chess; from bots.v12 import get_best_move; b = chess.Board(); print(get_best_move(b, depth=7))"

Missing Features / To-Do:
    Ranked by estimated Elo gain. Ranges are rough — small samples have wide CIs.

    --- Search ---

    Singular extensions                    ~10-20 Elo
        If the TT move at a node is significantly better than all alternatives,
        extend it by 1 ply. Run a reduced search (depth/2) excluding the TT move
        with a fail-low window (tt_score - margin). If it fails low, the TT move
        is singular — extend. Conditions: not root, not already extended, TT depth
        >= current-3, exact/beta flag, depth >= 8. Margin: 25*depth cp.

    Pondering                              ~20-40 Elo
        Search during the opponent's clock on the expected reply. If the opponent
        plays that move, the search result is reused immediately — effectively
        doubles thinking time for free. Complicates time management; config.yml
        already has ponder: false ready to flip.

    Staged move generation                 ~5-10 Elo (speed)
        TT pre-try is already in place. Next step: generate captures only first,
        then killers + quiets. If any capture causes a cutoff, quiets are never
        generated. Requires splitting generate_moves() into capture/quiet phases.

    Null move verification search          ~3-6 Elo
        At high depths (depth >= 12), after a null-move cutoff verify with a
        reduced search to avoid false prunes in zugzwang positions. Low priority
        since zugzwang is rare in open positions.

    Better time management                 ~5-10 Elo
        Scale time budget by position complexity: use more time when score has
        shifted sharply between iterations (instability already detected — could
        extend budget instead of just blocking easy-move exit). Use less time
        in clearly winning/losing positions.

    --- Evaluation ---

    Texel tuning (eval weight optimization) ~10-30 Elo
        Use a dataset of engine self-play or GM games to tune all PST values and
        eval weights via gradient descent. High implementation effort but the
        highest potential single-step gain. Stockfish, Ethereal all use this.

    Candidate passed pawns                 ~5-10 Elo
        Pawns that could become passed given the right pawn exchanges. Only fire
        when enemy_ahead_count == 1 and friendly_support_count >= 1. Give ~25%
        of the passed pawn bonus. Stricter than the v16 attempt that was removed.

    Weak squares / holes                   ~5-10 Elo
        Squares that can never be controlled by own pawns again penalize piece
        activity. Simplified version: penalize enemy knights sitting on squares
        not attackable by any own pawn (-20 cp per such knight).

    Threat detection in eval               ~5-8 Elo
        Reward positions where own pieces attack undefended enemy pieces; penalize
        positions where opponent has threats. Complements king attack count scoring.

    Endgame knowledge                      ~3-8 Elo
        KPK opposition logic (can king reach queening square before pawn),
        rook + pawn vs rook technique hints, mop-up eval improvements for
        queen/rook vs lone king. Currently relies on Lichess 7-piece tablebase.

    --- Infrastructure ---

    UCI multipv                            0 Elo (analysis only)
        Return N best moves. Useful for analysis; no effect on play strength.


Bot Version History:
    Random Bot - Makes a random move every turn

    mini_max_v1 - Uses mini max algo to find best position based on only material

    mini_max_v2 - Uses mini max algo to find best position based on material and position of knights and pawns, but does so incorrectly

    alpha_beta_mm_v3 - Uses alpha/beta pruning to speed up algo. Incentivizes good positioning for queen and bishop

    endgame_faster_v4 - Searches deeper in the endgame, optimizes get_adj_material algo

    castle_bot_v5 - rewards abaility to castle (1 point per side), rewards castling more (5 points)

    king_safety_v6 - rewards king safety, removes castling incentive, fixes material evaluation error

    quiescence_v7 - adds quiescence search, transposition table, repetition penalty, passed pawns, rook mobility, fixes castling bug from v6

    opening_book_v8 - plays e4/d4 as White and e5/d5 as Black on move 1, adds killer move heuristic,
                      null move pruning, check extensions, pawn structure penalties (doubled/isolated),
                      bishop pair bonus, transposition table size limit

    iterative_v9 - adds iterative deepening, late move reductions (LMR), full piece-square tables
                   for all pieces (with middlegame/endgame tapering for pawns and kings), king
                   centralization and proximity bonus in endgame, tapered evaluation using game phase

    optimized_v10 - major efficiency overhaul (~38x faster than v9). Negamax rewrite (eliminates
                    duplicated White/Black branches), TT stores best move for move ordering,
                    principal variation search (PVS), aspiration windows, flattened 1D PST tables,
                    bitboard passed pawn detection, history heuristic, MVV-LVA capture ordering,
                    LMR bug fix (capture check before push), optimized eval using board.pieces()

    time_managed_v11 - adds time-managed iterative deepening on top of v10. Dynamically allocates
                       time per move based on clock/increment/move number. Searches deeper when
                       more time is available, shallower in time pressure. Global time abort inside
                       negamax (checks every 2048 nodes) prevents overspending on a single move.
                       Minimum search depth of 5 ensures move quality.

    v12 - search efficiency improvements on top of v11. Futility pruning (skip quiet
                       moves at depth 1-2 when static eval + margin < alpha), quiescence move
                       ordering (MVV-LVA on captures), removed expensive board.is_game_over()
                       (detect checkmate/stalemate from empty legal moves), aspiration time guard
                       (skip re-search if >50% budget used), log-based LMR (bigger reductions for
                       later moves), lazy gives_check (only compute for LMR-eligible moves),
                       set-based isolated pawn detection. ~25% fewer nodes at same depth.
                       Deployed on Lichess via lichess-bot-master (account: tombot1234)

    v13 - full C rewrite of v12. Uses BBC (Bit Board Chess) by Code Monkey King as the
                       foundation for magic bitboard move generation, with v12's evaluation and
                       search logic ported on top. Speaks UCI protocol instead of homemade.
                       ~20x faster than v12 on PyPy (~1.3M nodes/sec), reaching depth 16 in
                       blitz time controls (v12 maxed at depth 10-11). All v12 features ported:
                       tapered eval, PSTs, passed pawns, mobility, pawn structure, bishop pair,
                       king safety, castling bonuses, king endgame, negamax with PVS, null move
                       pruning, LMR, futility pruning, aspiration windows, TT with best_move,
                       opening book, time management. Added distance-to-mate scoring.

                       Binary: c_rewrite/v13_engine (compiled with gcc -O3)

    v14 - search and time management improvements on top of v13. More aggressive time
                       usage (moves_left: 40/30/20 → 25/20/15, max budget cap: 20% → 33% of
                       clock, check_time threshold: 80% → 90%, depth-skip threshold: 40% → 55%,
                       aspiration bail threshold: 50% → 70%). Algorithm: reverse futility pruning
                       added (at depth ≤ 3, if static_eval - 100*depth ≥ beta, return early).
                       Efficiency: TIME_CHECK_INTERVAL doubled (2048 → 4096 nodes), TT prefetch
                       via __builtin_prefetch, quiescence pre-filter (break at first non-capture
                       before copy_board — eliminates ~25 wasted memcpys per qsearch node),
                       TT struct compacted 24→16 bytes (hash32 + signed char depth + uchar flag)
                       doubling TT entries to 4M (64MB) with 4 entries per cache line. Compiler:
                       -O3 -march=native -fomit-frame-pointer. Eval identical to v13 (eval changes
                       tested but reverted — hurt fixed-depth play). Lichess bot now offers
                       immediate rematch after a win. 50-game fixed-depth test (depth 10) vs v13:
                       v14 52% (+20 =12 -18). Depth-12 benchmark vs v13: 2.14x faster, 0.538x

    v15 - evaluation improvements on top of v14. New terms: rooks on open/semi-open
                       files (+20/+10), rook on 7th rank (+25 EG/+15 MG), king safety
                       open-file penalty near king (−10 open/−5 semi-open, MG only, half-
                       weight), knight outpost bonus (+15, +10 extra if pawn-defended),
                       backward pawn penalty (−10), tapered PSTs for bishops/rooks/queens
                       (separate MG and EG tables). Search and time management identical
                       to v14. 30-game fixed-depth test (depth 10) vs v14: v15 56.7%
                       (+13 =8 -9). Avg move time 108ms vs 101ms (+7%), nodes 287k vs
                       272k (+6%) — richer eval shifts pruning thresholds slightly.
                       Reaching depth 15-18 in blitz (vs v13's depth 16).

    v16 - search and evaluation improvements on top of v15. Search: 50-move rule
                       (halfmove clock now parsed and tracked; draw returned at >=100
                       half-moves), aspiration window gradual widening (±50 → ±150 →
                       ±450 → full on failure instead of jumping straight to full),
                       score instability / easy-move detection (exit search early if
                       best move stable 3+ depths with swing <30cp and past 40% of
                       budget), Internal Iterative Deepening (at PV nodes with no TT
                       hit and depth>=5, run depth-2 shallow search for move ordering).
                       Eval: rook behind passed pawn (+20), pawn shield quality scoring
                       (rank_dist=1: +15, rank_dist=2: +8, replaces flat shield count),
                       connected rooks (+15 if two rooks share clear file or rank),
                       pawn islands penalty (-8 per island beyond the first), king
                       mobility in endgame (+3 per safe move), insufficient material
                       draw detection (KK, KBK, KNK → 0). NOTE: tempo bonus (+10 for
                       side to move) was implemented and removed — adding it inside
                       evaluate() breaks quiescence: stand_pat gets +10 but captures
                       don't, so the engine rejects any capture worth <20cp. Candidate
                       passed pawns were also attempted but removed — the support-count
                       logic was too broad. 30-game fixed-depth test (depth 10) vs v15:
                       approximately equal (+9 =12 -8 for v15, 51.7%). Node ratio
                       0.97x v15 — features add search complexity but pruning offsets.

    v17 - search and evaluation improvements on top of v16. Search: adaptive null
                       move R (R = 3 + depth/6 instead of fixed R=3; at depth 12, R=5),

                       move piece/to-square, scored 700k — between killer 1 and history),
                       history malus + gravity (quiet moves that don't improve alpha take
                       a malus of depth²/2 with gravity scaling; bonus uses gravity:

                       pawn on same color squares as bishop); king attack count scoring —
                       counts enemy pieces attacking the 8 squares around the king with
                       weights (Q=5, R=3, B=2, N=2, P=1), penalty = danger²/4 capped at
                       150cp, middlegame only. TT: clustered transposition table — 4

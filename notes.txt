Bot Description:
    Random Bot - Makes a random move every turn
    
    mini_max_v1 - Uses mini max algo to find best position based on only material
    
    mini_max_v2 - Uses mini max algo to find best position based on material and position of knights and pawns, but does so incorrectly
    
    alpha_beta_mm_v3 - Uses alpha/beta pruning to speed up algo. Incentivizes good positioning for queen and bishop
    
    endgame_faster_v4 - Searches deeper in the endgame, optimizes get_adj_material algo
    
    castle_bot_v5 - rewards abaility to castle (1 point per side), rewards castling more (5 points)
    
    king_safety_v6 - rewards king safety, removes castling incentive, fixes material evaluation error

    quiescence_v7 - adds quiescence search, transposition table, repetition penalty, passed pawns, rook mobility, fixes castling bug from v6

    opening_book_v8 - plays e4/d4 as White and e5/d5 as Black on move 1, adds killer move heuristic,
                      null move pruning, check extensions, pawn structure penalties (doubled/isolated),
                      bishop pair bonus, transposition table size limit

    iterative_v9 - adds iterative deepening, late move reductions (LMR), full piece-square tables
                   for all pieces (with middlegame/endgame tapering for pawns and kings), king
                   centralization and proximity bonus in endgame, tapered evaluation using game phase

    optimized_v10 - major efficiency overhaul (~38x faster than v9). Negamax rewrite (eliminates
                    duplicated White/Black branches), TT stores best move for move ordering,
                    principal variation search (PVS), aspiration windows, flattened 1D PST tables,
                    bitboard passed pawn detection, history heuristic, MVV-LVA capture ordering,
                    LMR bug fix (capture check before push), optimized eval using board.pieces()

    time_managed_v11 - adds time-managed iterative deepening on top of v10. Dynamically allocates
                       time per move based on clock/increment/move number. Searches deeper when
                       more time is available, shallower in time pressure. Global time abort inside
                       negamax (checks every 2048 nodes) prevents overspending on a single move.
                       Minimum search depth of 5 ensures move quality.

    v12 - search efficiency improvements on top of v11. Futility pruning (skip quiet
                       moves at depth 1-2 when static eval + margin < alpha), quiescence move
                       ordering (MVV-LVA on captures), removed expensive board.is_game_over()
                       (detect checkmate/stalemate from empty legal moves), aspiration time guard
                       (skip re-search if >50% budget used), log-based LMR (bigger reductions for
                       later moves), lazy gives_check (only compute for LMR-eligible moves),
                       set-based isolated pawn detection. ~25% fewer nodes at same depth.
                       Deployed on Lichess via lichess-bot-master (account: tombot1234)

    v13 - full C rewrite of v12. Uses BBC (Bit Board Chess) by Code Monkey King as the
                       foundation for magic bitboard move generation, with v12's evaluation and
                       search logic ported on top. Speaks UCI protocol instead of homemade.
                       ~20x faster than v12 on PyPy (~1.3M nodes/sec), reaching depth 16 in
                       blitz time controls (v12 maxed at depth 10-11). All v12 features ported:
                       tapered eval, PSTs, passed pawns, mobility, pawn structure, bishop pair,
                       king safety, castling bonuses, king endgame, negamax with PVS, null move
                       pruning, LMR, futility pruning, aspiration windows, TT with best_move,
                       opening book, time management. Added distance-to-mate scoring.

Lichess Bot Setup:
    - Account: tombot1234
    - Engine: v13_engine (UCI protocol)
    - Config: lichess-bot-master/config.yml
    - Time controls: blitz, rapid, classical
    - Matchmaking: auto-challenges other bots every 1 min
    - Uses Lichess opening explorer (masters) and online endgame tablebases (7-piece)
    - Run with: cd lichess-bot-master && python lichess-bot.py


Running the Bot:
    # Compile the v13 C engine (only needed once, or after code changes):
    cd c_rewrite && make

    # Run the Lichess bot (same command as before, config now points to v13):
    cd lichess-bot-master && python lichess-bot.py

    # Test the engine directly via UCI:
    echo -e "uci\nisready\nposition startpos moves e2e4 e7e5\ngo depth 10\nquit" | ./c_rewrite/v13_engine

    # Old v12 Python engine (still available):
    python -c "import chess; from bots.v12 import get_best_move; b = chess.Board(); print(get_best_move(b, depth=7))"
